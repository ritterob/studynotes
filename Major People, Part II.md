<h2 id="thursday-june-4-abraham">Thursday, June 4: Abraham</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.13">Genesis 13</a></p>
<p>Our first look at Abraham in this reading tells us three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>He was blessed by God. He and those with him had accumulated so much wealth that there wasn’t enough grazing land for him and Lot to live close to each other.</li>
<li>He was humble. Even though it was Abraham that God had spoken to, and Abraham that God was leading, he did not hold his implicit authority over his kinsman. Abraham graciously gave Lot the choice of grazing lands, and he humbly accepted what Lot didn’t want.</li>
<li>He trusted in God. After Abraham ventured west, deeper into Canaanite territory, God repeated his land promise to him. Abraham had originally entered Canaan and camped at Moreh, where God first made his land promise. There Abraham built an altar to God. Then he had moved to Bethel and built a second altar. Then they had sojourned for a while in Egypt, and were returning to Canaan, living in the Negev as we enter chapter 13. After parting from Lot, Abraham moved to Mamre, where God reiterated the land promise, and there he built a third altar to the Lord.</li>
</ol>

<p>We also learn something about Lot. He was looking out for his own <em>material</em> interests. He chose the better-looking land, but that put him in dangerous proximity to the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Jordan valley was lush and well-watered, so it was enticing to the younger man. But he seems to have ignored his <em>spiritual</em> or <em>moral</em> interests. It would have been better for him to settle elsewhere, and in the end he lost almost everything because of this rash decision (see ch. 19).</p>
<h2 id="friday-june-5-abraham-cont.">Friday, June 5: Abraham (cont.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.14">Genesis 14</a></p>
<p>Chapter 14 unveils more of Abraham’s character to us.</p>
<ol>
<li>He was loyal. We might notice that, within a short space of time, Lot has already moved into Sodom. Chapters 14–16 appear to be in chronological order, and the events of chapter 16 occur 10 years after Abraham and Lot had separated and settled in the land. Whatever enticed Lot to move into the city, be it protection, commerce, convenience, or something else, he had decided to make Sodom his home. Despite this unwise choice, Abraham still cared for him and struck out to rescue him when he was captured in the spoils of war.</li>
<li>He had integrity. Abraham wanted nothing to do with the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah, and refused to take any of the plunder from the battle for himself. He still insisted that the men with him receive a reward, but he himself would not be enriched by the spoils. This calls to mind the words of Paul to the Thessalonians: “Abstain from every form of evil,” and Jude: “hating even the garment stained by the flesh.”</li>
<li>He publicly recognized God’s sovereignty and protection. Before all the kings of Canaan, Abraham gave a tenth of everything to God. This acknowledged that Abraham did <em>not</em> believe it was by his might, but rather God’s, that he had conquered his enemies and rescued these people.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="saturday-june-6-abraham-cont.">Saturday, June 6: Abraham (cont.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.16">Genesis 16</a></p>
<p>In chapter 15 God had promised Abraham that he would have a son from his own body as an heir to the promises. Abraham seemed to accept this on faith, though he didn’t understand the logistics behind the fulfillment. How would God bring forth a son from two dried-up old people? So, when Sarah proposes a solution, he seems to think that this must be what God was talking about. Sarah gives Abraham her handmaid as a concubine, and Abraham gets her pregnant.</p>
<p>So, while Abraham may have accepted God’s word as inviolate, he didn’t think it unusual to help God along with the process. After all, even though God had given him victory over the four Mesopotamian kings, Abraham was not excused from action, and still had to fight for the victory. Sarah’s conclusion that perhaps Abraham is supposed to <em>do</em> something about this promise isn’t necessarily out of character for God.</p>
<p>From the vision of hindsight, though, we know that this was <em>not</em> God’s intent. Sarah, who was unable to bear children, was to be the mother of Isaac, making him a child of promise, conceived miraculously. Paul wrote to the Galatians: “the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>God will demonstrate his power and authority in the birth of Isaac, but he also shows his great compassion in the birth of Ishmael. This boy, too, will be the ancestor of a multitude of people, God’s promises to Abraham spilling over into the life of the Egyptian Hagar.</p>
<p>Remember that one of the promises of God to Abraham was that “in [him] all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> So far Abraham has been a blessing to Lot, to the neighbors among whom he lives, and to this Egyptian slave. And God is only getting started.</p>
<h2 id="sunday-june-7-abraham-cont.">Sunday, June 7: Abraham (cont.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.17">Genesis 17</a></p>
<p>At ninety-nine years of age, one might think that Abraham didn’t have much to offer. Even at this late stage in his life—or, perhaps, <em>because</em> of it—God appeared to Abraham to reaffirm both the land and nation promises that he had made back at the beginning of Abraham’s call. He seals this with a very special gift—a new name. Remember that God allowed Adam to name the animals, and even woman. When the creator of the universe decides to give you a name, that is something special indeed. So, “exalted father” Abram becomes <em>Abraham,</em> father of a multitude.</p>
<p>Even as God is changing his name, Abraham still hasn’t witnessed the promised son. Thinking that he and Sarah can’t possibly have a child, he begs God to consider his son, Ishmael. God does indeed bless Ishmael with a portion of the promise—he, too, will be a father to many. But the land promise will pass solely to Isaac.</p>
<p>This chapter also introduces circumcision, the sign of the covenant between God and Abraham. To this point the signs of the promise had been temporary: a survey of the land of Canaan;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup> the vista of the night sky;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> a fire passed between the carcasses of animals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup> <em>This</em> sign would a permanent mark in Abraham’s flesh as a constant reminder of his relationship with God. Every male in his lineage was to bear this mark to show honor to the covenant. Circumcision was not original to Judaism,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup> but Abraham’s circumcision, and that of his household, had a very specific covenant purpose, so was important to God: “Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant,” Genesis 17:14.</p>

<h2 id="monday-june-8-abraham-concl.">Monday, June 8: Abraham (concl.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.24">Genesis 24</a></p>
<p>Forty-one years later<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup> Abraham is still demonstrating his trust in God, sending his servant to find a wife for Isaac among his kinsmen. And God is still showering Abraham with faithful kindness by providing for the servant’s success and Isaac’s future. An interesting thing to note is that Abraham’s relationship with God was not a private thing. We’ve already read how he honored God before the Canaanite kings in chapter 14 by giving a tithe of the spoils of war to Melchizedek, priest of God Most High. It’s little wonder that Abraham’s trusted servant knew of this relationship and relied on it when he sought out a wife for Isaac.</p>
<p>As we set the stage for the stories of Abraham’s descendants, I noticed one thing that I don’t recall picking up on before. In verse 60 Rebekah’s family blessed her with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands,<br>
and may your offspring possess the gate of those who hate him!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laban’s own mouth called down a curse on the enemies of Rebekah’s offspring—and he would later cheat and steal from Rebekah’s son, Jacob, only to enrich and empower him in the process through the blessing of God. The plot thickens!</p>
