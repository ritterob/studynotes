<h2 id="thursday-may-28-noah">Thursday, May 28: Noah</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.6">Genesis 6</a></p>
<p>We are told that the general state of the earth at this time is “wickedness,” and that man continually intended evil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>5</sup>The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the evil <em>specifically</em> mentioned here is “violence.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>11</sup>Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight, <mark>and the earth was filled with violence.</mark> <sup>12</sup>And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth. <sup>13</sup>And God said to Noah, “I have determined to make an end of all flesh, <mark>for the earth is filled with violence through them.</mark> Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are told that “Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord,” that he was “a righteous man, blameless in his generation,” and that he “walked with God.” (vv 8 &amp; 9)</p>
<ol>
<li>Noah was counter-culture. Since the prevailing character of society was violent, Noah must have been a peaceable man.</li>
<li>Noah did “all that God commanded him.”</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="friday-may-29-noah-cont.">Friday, May 29: Noah (cont.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.7">Genesis 7</a></p>
<p>Why did God:</p>
<ol>
<li>destroy <em>all</em> animals from the surface of the earth, rather than just humans?</li>
<li>spare the aquatic creatures?</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps we can see an answer in verse 22:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “breath of life” was sometimes a metaphor for God’s spirit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. <strong>Genesis 2:7</strong></p>
<p>The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. <strong>Job 33:4</strong></p>
<p>But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. <strong>Revelation 11:11</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that God had said in Genesis 6:3, “My Spirit shall not abide in man forever.” Perhaps the destruction of all breathing life indicates God’s utter contempt for man’s wickedness. Humans had thoroughly perverted the spirit God had blessed them with, so he removed every trace, every reminder of that spirit, except for those he spared on the ark.</p>
<p>Thus, the last words in the psalms declare, “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!. Praise the Lord!”</p>
<h2 id="saturday-may-30-noah-cont.">Saturday, May 30: Noah (cont.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.8">Genesis 8</a></p>
<p>It seems that Noah’s curiosity—perhaps his desire to get out of a boat filled with noisy, smelly animals and into some fresh air—caused him to open the roof of the ark and send out some scouts to check the water levels. However, even when the dove he sent failed to return, indicating that the water had receded, it wasn’t until God instructed him did he leave the ark.</p>
<p>Noah continued to do “all that God commanded him,” and demonstrated a spirit of patience. He also demonstrated his thankfulness to God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. <strong>Genesis 8:20</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sunday-may-31-noah-cont.">Sunday, May 31: Noah (cont.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.9">Genesis 9</a></p>
<h3 id="god-still-hates-violence.">God <em>still</em> hates violence.</h3>
<p>As God gives new instructions to Noah about man’s relationship with creation (vv 1–7), he reiterates his abhorrence of violence by giving a new commandment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.</p>
<p>“Whoever sheds the blood of man,<br>
by man shall his blood be shed,<br>
for God made man in his own image."</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 9:5-6</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="noah-relieves-a-little-tension.">Noah relieves a little tension.</h3>
<p>While it’s easy to fault Noah for his drunkenness, let’s remember that we have no specific commandment from God at this time <em>against</em> it. Solomon would later observe its danger, “Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.” In the New Covenant Paul, Peter, and Jesus all denounce it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. <strong>Galatians 5:19-21</strong></p>
<p>Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God. For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry. <strong>1 Peter 4:1-3</strong></p>
<p>“But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap.” <strong>Luke 21:34</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as we know, Noah was under no such injunction. Moses tells this story not to find fault with Noah, but with Ham. I <em>does</em> point out the embarrassments that come of drunkenness, but its primary purpose is to set the stage for relations between the Hebrews and the Canaanites. As Moses’s readers might wonder who these Canaanites were and why they were going to dispossess them, we see the first indication that God chose to honor Shem, from whom the Jews descend, and curse Canaan.</p>
<h2 id="monday-june-1-noah-concl.">Monday, June 1: Noah (concl.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.10">Genesis 10</a></p>
<p>As the story of Noah closes, Moses traces the origins of the Canaanite nations from Ham. We also get the genealogy of Shem, which will segue into the story of Abram. We can note that God had called Israel “according to his purpose” even before Abram was born.</p>
